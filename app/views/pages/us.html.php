			<h3>Us</h3>
			<p>If you were to visit our studio right now, you’d probably find us hacking away at something. Making stuff with pixels or wires or paper, or just about anything we can get our hands on and tinker with. This is what we love doing, and we pour that energy and excitement into every project we undertake.</p>
			<p>We’re experienced makers, drawn together by a mutual desire to produce things that help organisations further their work.</p>
			<p>Fieldwork is the creative partnership of designer and art director, Loz Ives, and web developer and maker of digital things, Andy Gott.</p>

			<h3>Our Approach</h3>
			<p>We build things with you, collaboratively, to support and enhance the work that you do. Combining the experience and knowledge that you have about your work, with the experience and knowledge that we have about ours, we make things that have a real impact.</p>
			<p>When it comes to exploring the possibilities and having new ideas, making stuff is more effective than thinking about it. We start sketching and prototyping at the very beginning.</p>

		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p class="centered-intro runner">Through our work on various digital and branding projects, we’ve developed a solid process for collaboratively exploring problems, and delivering effective solutions.</p>
		<ul class="process-overview grid">
			<li class="learn col-3-1">
				<h4>Learn</h4>
				<p>Together, we learn about your organisation and the project’s context, define goals, devise a high level strategy, and outline a scope of work.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="make col-3-1">
				<h4>Make</h4>
				<p>We prototype ideas, test elements of the project, figure out how the things we’re making will work as a larger system, and refine the successful parts.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="deliver col-3-1">
				<h4>Deliver</h4>
				<p>Finally, we develop and deploy final products and assets, and work out how best to launch the project for the most positive impact.</p>
