			<h3>Us</h3>
			<p>If you were to visit our studio right now, you’d probably find us tinkering away with something, making things with pixels, wires or paper. This is what we love doing, and we pour that energy and excitement into every project we undertake.</p>
			<p>Fieldwork was founded in 2012 by Loz Ives and Andy Gott, a pair of experienced makers, drawn together by a mutual desire to produce things that help organisations further their work.</p>

			<h3>Our Approach</h3>
			<p>We build things with you, collaboratively, to support and enhance the work that you do. Combining your knowledge of your organisation and its work, with our experience and design process, we produce things that have real impact.</p>

		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p class="centered-intro runner">Through our work on various digital and branding projects, we’ve developed a process for collaboratively exploring problems, and delivering effective solutions.</p>

				<h4>Learn</h4>
				<p>Together, we learn about your organisation and the project’s context, define goals, devise a high level strategy, and outline a scope of work.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="make col-3-1">

				<h4>Make</h4>
				<p>We prototype ideas, test elements of the project, figure out how the things we’re making will work as a larger system, and refine the successful parts.</p>

			<li class="deliver col-3-1">

				<h4>Deliver</h4>
				<p>Finally, we develop and deploy final products and assets, and work out how best to launch the project for the most positive impact.</p>
